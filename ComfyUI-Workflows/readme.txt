ComfyUI workflows
The Ace Step 1.5 workflow condenses nodes with subgraphs, to hide stuff you will likely never want to change.
It also adds the option to use an audio file as the latent noise.
It also saves the file with the custom node Yanc which has the date/time format for saving the audio file, but you can delete those 2 if you don't want to use it.
Also added the default node with defeault settings as a disabled node, not connected, for reference.
Lastly, I added a prompt you can copy/paste to an LLM like gemini to make music lyrics/settings.
Also some notes and colored the nodes.
That's all. Nothing else special about this workflow.
