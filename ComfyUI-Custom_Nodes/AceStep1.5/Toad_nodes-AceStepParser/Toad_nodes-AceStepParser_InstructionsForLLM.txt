AceStep 1.5 song lyrics writing chat.
Always use the plaintext for all codeblocks in this chat, so that the copy function is available.

Write lyrics for Ace Step 1.5 in ComfyUI made for a custom node, with the correct tags for style and insure that everything is in this order because this was made for a custom node that requires everything be correct.
Be aware that with lyrics, anything in parenthesis is used as a description, not as background vocals.
If a line of lyrics says:
"Hello (hi hi hi hi)"
it will determine that "(hi hi hi hi)" describes how to say "Hello", so do not use it for background vocals
a proper use would be:
"Hello (yelling)"
Also, I don't think it can do sound effects, but i could be wrong, so if you say (a dog barking) or (a dripping faucet) I think it will just ignore them.
First start with 3 horizontal lines at the top as the first 3 lines.
After those 3 horizontal lines, 
Here is the example plaintext format codeblock that i have enclosed within 3 backticks:

```
[tags]
K-Pop: A slick, maximalist K-pop track that genre-hops with precision and style. The production shifts seamlessly between sections—a hard-hitting trap-influenced verse with rapid-fire rapping, a softer R&B pre-chorus with breathy vocals and lush harmonies, then an explosive, synth-driven pop chorus with an ear worm hook.

[lyrics]
[Intro - Synth Rise & Vocal Chop]
yeah—
uh
turn it up (yelling)

[Verse 1 - Trap Rap]
Click-clack, camera flash, we don’t miss
Run the board, every move calculated

Radar locked, yeah I’m on that lane
Drip so sharp, cut through champagne

[Verse 2 - Trap Rap]
808 talk, let it shake the floor

Chain reaction when I breathe that fire
One line, whole room go higher

[Pre-Chorus - R&B]
Pull me closer, slow it down
Heartbeat under the sound

Lights go low, voices melt
Every note just how I felt

[Chorus - Pop Explosion]
Boom, boom, feel it in your chest
When the beat drop, we the best

Flash, flash, colors collide

[Post-Chorus - Chant]
Hey!
Turn it loud

[Outro]
  
Length: 184
bpm: 191
keyscale: A# major
Time Signature: 4
```

That is the example, now to ensure you get all the details right:
Below the plaintext format codeblock, please add 3 horizontal lines so that it is well defined visually that it has reached the end of the data for me to copy. This will make the entire ouput distinctly separated from the rest by having 3 horizontal lines at the very top of your output and 3 horizontal lines after the plaintext format codeblock, making it easier to copy/paste.

After the first 3 horizontal lines at the time, The first text line will only be [tags]
the next line will be the tags that describe what the song will sound like, as in the example, and this is all as a single paragraph.

The second section will be [lyrics]
the next line will be the lyrics broken up into multiple lines, as seen in the example above.

The final section will be the 4 variables:

The Length of songs in Seconds as an integer, such as 120.
bpm is the beats per minute integer, such as 68 or 413.
keyscale, such as E Minor, Cb, A#, D Minor, do not give locrian.
and Time Signature, only options are: 2, 3, 4 or 6.

Be sure that the category [tags] is on it's own line above the tags, not on the same line.
Be sure the category [lyrics] ison a line above the lyrics, not on the same line.

i will tell you what songs to make in the next message.
I will not have to say the phrase "make a song" or "make a song about" because all messages are implied to be for making a song.
For this first response, to ensure you do not skip anything, 
Now, create 3 horizontal lines, then provide to me in a plaintext format codeblock, what i have enclosed within the 3 backticks:
```
[tags]
Genre/description/tags

[lyrics]
lyrics with bracket verse type of things

Length
bpm
keyscale
Time Signature
```

Now end with the 3 horizontal lines directly below, to ensure you understand all of what I explained above, 
then say this formatted text:

This format was made for: Toad Nodes: AceStep Song Parser v1.5 ComfyUI custom node.  
Describe a song.  
Optional to specify: Genre, speed, length, style/type, etc.  
Example 0: dogs  
Example 1: make a song about a dog  
Example 2: make a song about a dog playing with a ball, make it cheerful and uplifting  
Example 3: make a fast paced punk rock song about a dog playing with a ball, make it cheerful and uplifting and make the lyrics only 4 very short lines and make it a total of 30 seconds long  
  
I'm ready to make songs.
