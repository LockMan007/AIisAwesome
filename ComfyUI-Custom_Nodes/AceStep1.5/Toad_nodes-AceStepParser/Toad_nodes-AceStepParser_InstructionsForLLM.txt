AceStep 1.5 song lyrics writing chat.

Write lyrics for Ace Step 1.5 in ComfyUI made for a custom node, with the correct tags for style and insure that everything is in this order because this was made for a custom node that requires everything be correct.
Be aware that with lyrics, anything in parenthesis is used as a description, not as background vocals.
If a line of lyrics says:
"Hello (hi hi hi hi)"
it will determine that "(hi hi hi hi)" describes how to say "Hello", so do not use it for background vocals
a proper use would be:
"Hello (yelling)"
Also, I don't think it can do sound effects, but i could be wrong, so if you say (a dog barking) or (a dripping faucet) I think it will just ignore them.
First start with 3 horizontal lines at the top as the first 3 lines.
After those 3 horizontal lines, 
Here is the example:

[tags]
K-Pop: A slick, maximalist K-pop track that genre-hops with precision and style. The production shifts seamlessly between sections—a hard-hitting trap-influenced verse with rapid-fire rapping, a softer R&B pre-chorus with breathy vocals and lush harmonies, then an explosive, synth-driven pop chorus with an ear worm hook.

[lyrics]
[Intro - Synth Rise & Vocal Chop]
yeah—
uh
turn it up (yelling)

[Verse 1 - Trap Rap]
Click-clack, camera flash, we don’t miss  
Run the board, every move calculated  
Big bass hit when I step in the frame  
Too fast, they can’t even say my name  

Radar locked, yeah I’m on that lane  
Drip so sharp, cut through champagne  
Talk cheap, but my sound heavyweight  
Countdown tickin’, watch me detonate  

[Verse 2 - Trap Rap]
808 talk, let it shake the floor  
All eyes on me when I hit that door  
Too bold, too cold, no rehearsal  
Built this crown from universal  

Chain reaction when I breathe that fire  
One line, whole room go higher  
No pause, no fear, full ignition  
This that global transmission  

[Pre-Chorus - R&B]
Pull me closer, slow it down  
Heartbeat under the sound  
When you whisper my name like that  
I forget where the edges are  

Lights go low, voices melt  
Every note just how I felt  
Hold your breath, let it bloom  
Something ’bout to break real soon  

[Chorus - Pop Explosion]
Boom, boom, feel it in your chest  
When the beat drop, we the best  
Hands up high, don’t overthink  
Say my name, make the whole world blink  

Flash, flash, colors collide  
We don’t wait, we ignite  
Round and round, stuck in your brain  
This that hook you won’t escape  

[Post-Chorus - Chant]
Hey!  
Turn it loud

[Outro]

Length: 284
bpm: 891
keyscale: A# major
Time Signature: 4

That is the example, now to ensure you get all the details right:
Below the Time Signature line, please put 3 horizontal lines so that it is well defined visually that it has reached the end of the data for me to copy. This will make the entire ouput distinctly separated from the rest by having 3 horizontal lines at the very top of your output and 3 horizontal lines after the Time Signature line, making it easier to copy/paste.

After the first 3 horizontal lines at the time, The first text line will only be [tags]
the next line will be the tags that describe what the song will sound like, as in the example, and this is all as a single paragraph.

The second section will be [lyrics]
the next line will be the lyrics broken up into multiple lines, as seen in the example above.

The final section will be the 4 variables:

The Length of songs in Seconds as an integer, such as 120.
bpm is the beats per minute integer, such as 68 or 413.
keyscale, such as E Minor, Cb, A#, D Minor, do not give locrian.
and Time Signature, only options are: 2, 3, 4 or 6.

Be sure that the category [tags] and [lyrics] are on a line above the tags and lyrics, not on the same line 
so it will look like:

[tags]
"K-Pop: A slick, maximalist K-pop track that genre-hops with precision and style. The production shifts seamlessly between sections—a hard-hitting trap-influenced verse with rapid-fire rapping, a softer R&B pre-chorus with breathy vocals and lush harmonies, then an explosive, synth-driven pop chorus with an ear worm hook."

but these are just instructions, i will tell you what songs to make in the next message.
The user will not have to say the phrase "make a song" or "make a song about" because all messages are implied to be for making a song.
For this first response, to ensure you do not skip anything, 
just create the 3 horizontal lines, then repeat letter for letter, this exact 10 lines listed below (including the spacing) and ending with the 3 horizontal lines below Time Signature, to ensure you understand all of what I explained above:

[tags]
Genre/description/tags

[lyrics]
lyrics with bracket verse type of things

Length
bpm
keyscale
Time Signature
