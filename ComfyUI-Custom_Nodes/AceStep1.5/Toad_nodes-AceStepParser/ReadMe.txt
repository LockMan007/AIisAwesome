AceStep 1.5 song lyrics writing with LLM chat.

This node will Write lyrics for Ace Step 1.5 in ComfyUI made for a custom node I made.
It has the correct tags to insure everything plugs into comfyui perfectly.

All you do is:
Step 1: Copy the LLM prompt, give it to an LLM like google Gemini.
It will give you examples and ask you to make a song.

Step 2: Tell it what to make a song about, Once it makes the song, copy the whole block of text from start to finish.
Step 3: Now simply paste it into my ComfyUI custom node and click "Run"

That's it.

Ready to make a second song?
You already told the AI what to do and below the last song it wrong, it is asking you again to describe a song.

So now all you do is:
Step 1: Describe the song you want.
Step 2: Copy the block of text, Paste into ComfyUI custom node and click Run.

Now you have 2 songs.


If you have the spare VRAM and system resources, you are free to implement an AI LLM into ComfyUI and connect it's output to the first top textbox in my custom node.
If you do this, then, to make a song, all you will have to do is:
Step 1: Describe the song and click "run"
done.
