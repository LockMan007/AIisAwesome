AceStep 1.5 song lyrics writing chat.

Write lyrics with the correct tags for style, such as:

[tags]
K-Pop: A slick, maximalist K-pop track that genre-hops with precision and style. The production shifts seamlessly between sections—a hard-hitting trap-influenced verse with rapid-fire rapping, a softer R&B pre-chorus with breathy vocals and lush harmonies, then an explosive, synth-driven pop chorus with an ear worm hook.

start the lyrics with a [lyrics] first
and write the sections for lyrics tags in brackets for each section like this:

[lyrics]
[Intro - Synth Rise & Vocal Chop]
yeah—
uh
turn it up

[Verse 1 - Trap Rap]
Click-clack, camera flash, we don’t miss  
Run the board, every move calculated  
Big bass hit when I step in the frame  
Too fast, they can’t even say my name  

Radar locked, yeah I’m on that lane  
Drip so sharp, cut through champagne  
Talk cheap, but my sound heavyweight  
Countdown tickin’, watch me detonate  

[Verse 2 - Trap Rap]
808 talk, let it shake the floor  
All eyes on me when I hit that door  
Too bold, too cold, no rehearsal  
Built this crown from universal  

Chain reaction when I breathe that fire  
One line, whole room go higher  
No pause, no fear, full ignition  
This that global transmission  

[Pre-Chorus - R&B]
Pull me closer, slow it down  
Heartbeat under the sound  
When you whisper my name like that  
I forget where the edges are  

Lights go low, voices melt  
Every note just how I felt  
Hold your breath, let it bloom  
Something ’bout to break real soon  

[Chorus - Pop Explosion]
Boom, boom, feel it in your chest  
When the beat drop, we the best  
Hands up high, don’t overthink  
Say my name, make the whole world blink  

Flash, flash, colors collide  
We don’t wait, we ignite  
Round and round, stuck in your brain  
This that hook you won’t escape  

[Post-Chorus - Chant]
Hey!  
Turn it loud

[Outro]

also i need this information:
Length of songs in Seconds as an integer, such as 120
bpm the beats per minute integer, such as 68 or 413
keyscale, such as E Minor, Cb, A#, D Minor, do not give locrian.
and Time Signature, only options are: 2, 3, 4 or 6

in this format:
Length: 284
bpm: 891
keyscale: A# major
Time Signature: 4

be sure to provide the music style mentioned at the top, and remember to have a newline above it, with the category [tags]
so it will look like:

[tags]
"K-Pop: A slick, maximalist K-pop track that genre-hops with precision and style.

also before the lyrics be sure you put a [lyrics] above them on a new line like in the example.

but these are just instructions, i will tell you what songs to make in the next message.
For this first response, to ensure you do not skip anything, 
just repeat letter for letter, this exact 6 item list below, to ensure you understand all of what I explained above:

Genre/description/tags
lyrics with bracket verse type of things
Length
bpm
keyscale
Time Signature

then say "I'm ready to make songs, just tell me what you want the song about and optional a vague music style/type that i will enhance better based on the lyrics I create"
