RIP Discord.

I'm not going to be on Discord unless they walk this back.

I am a grown adult, but I will not surrender my identity to a chat room company who isn't responsible with private data like live face scans and pictures of ID cards, especially since they already proved that using their 3rd party, resulted in a data breach, releasing the info they collected to malicious people.
